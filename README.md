# TITrig
Triangle solver for the TI-84 Plus CE

# Features

TITrig can solve for any type of triangle, right or non-right.

# Non-right triangles
- Displays any extraneous angles
- Automatically detects the type of triangle (i.e. SSS, SAS, etc.) and displays it
- Automatically solves for the third angle when possible
- Automatically calculates the area and perimeter
- Automatically solves for the triangle when possible

# Right triangles
- Automatically solves for the missing side (pythagorean theorem)
- Automatically solves for the third angle when possible
- Displays all trigonometric ratios (sin, cos, tan, cot, csc, sec)
- Can display the trigonometric ratios in either plain fractions (decimals) or as simplified radicals
- Displays the simplified radical form of a decimal when a decimal is selected

# TODO
- The clear function in the right triangle mode is currently unimplemented
